# Plant Growth Analysis

## Overview
This project involves the analysis of plant growth over several days, using Google Sheets for data recording and analysis. The purpose is to understand the relationship between plant maturity and various environmental conditions.

## Data Recorded
- **Plant Maturity Days:** Monitoring the number of days each plant takes to reach maturity (Days 44 to 48).
- **Number of Plants Grown:** Counting the number of plants maturing each day.
- **Percentage of Plants:** Calculating the percentage of plants maturing on each specific day.
- **Environmental Conditions:** Recording average daily values for temperature (°C), humidity (%), pH levels, and TDS values.

## Key Observations
- The majority of plants (82.86%) reached maturity on day 45 under the following conditions:
  - **Average Temperature:** 28.10°C
  - **Average Humidity:** 64.90%
  - **Average pH Level:** 6.40
  - **Average TDS Value:** 597.10
- Other days showed fewer plants maturing, with day 44 having the least (1.43%).

## Technological Application
### Using Google Sheets:
- **Data Entry and Organization:** Raw data for each variable was entered in tabular form.
- **Percentage Calculations:** Formulas were used to calculate the percentage of plants maturing each day.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Functions were applied to determine averages of environmental conditions for each maturity day.
- **Visual Representation:** Charts and graphs were created to visualize trends and correlations between plant growth and environmental factors.

## Conclusion
This analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of using Google Sheets for comprehensive data management and analysis in agricultural studies.
